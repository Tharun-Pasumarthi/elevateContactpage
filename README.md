# Contact Form Project

A modern contact form with advanced CSS styling and robust JavaScript validation.

## Features
- Name, Email, and Message fields
- Client-side validation for all fields
- Email must end with `.com` or `.in` (with example shown on error)
- Error messages displayed below inputs
- Success message on valid submission (no actual sending)
- Responsive and visually appealing design
- Favicon included

## How to Use
1. Open `contact-form.html` in your browser (Chrome recommended).
2. Fill out the form and test validation (try empty fields, invalid emails, etc).
3. On valid submission, a success message will appear.

## Customization
- To change the favicon, replace `favicon.svg` with your own SVG or PNG and update the link in the HTML head.
- To adjust validation rules, edit the JavaScript in `contact-form.html`.
